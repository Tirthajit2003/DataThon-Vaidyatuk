Our team Data Titans achieved the 1st Rank in DataThon-ML Hackathon conducted by the ETC department of IIEST Shibpur.

The problem statements are as follows:-

Problem 1: Online Retail Transactions Analysis

Comprehending consumer behaviour in virtual retail transactions is crucial for e-commerce enterprises to achieve prosperity. Transaction data analysis yields insightful information that may be used to develop plans for many areas of the company. The major priority is enhancing client satisfaction is one of transaction analysis's main advantages. Businesses may find pain areas, improve the overall online buying experience, and streamline operations by carefully examining the complete consumer journey. Increased client loyalty and satisfaction are a result of this optimisation. Another important factor that is influenced by transaction insights is personalisation. Businesses may customise marketing campaigns by exploring the unique tastes, purchase history, and browsing behaviours of each consumer. This personalisation includes making product recommendations that are appropriate, creating promotions that are specifically targeted, and providing an enhanced online experience.


Dataset Description
This dataset collects vital information for organisations looking to improve their client base understanding by including a variety of factors connected to customer purchase habits. Age, gender, purchase amount, preferred payment methods, frequency of transactions, and feedback ratings are among the aspects that customers can choose from. Data is also provided on the kinds of goods bought, how often they buy, when they like to shop, and how they use special offers. This 4720-record dataset provides a starting point for companies wishing to use data-driven insights to improve decision-making and customer-focused strategy.

Primary Objective
In this challenge, the objective is to analyze and derive insights from two distinct datasets related to online retail transactions.

Examples for Analysis
Top-Selling Products and Categories: - Identify and analyze the top-selling products and categories based on transaction frequency or revenue.
Customer Purchasing Behavior Patterns: - Investigate trends in customer purchasing behavior based on demographics (age, gender, etc.).
Customer Ratings and Product Satisfaction: - Analyze customer ratings and feedback to understand overall product satisfaction.
Impact of Discounts or Promotions: - Explore the impact of discounts or promotions on sales by analyzing transaction data during promotional periods.
Seasonality of Product Purchases: - Investigate the seasonality of product purchases by analyzing monthly or quarterly sales trends.
Bonus Challenge
Relate Both Datasets:
Identify commonalities and differences in top-selling products and customer behavior between Dataset A and Dataset B.
Explore any correlations or patterns that emerge when considering both datasets collectively.
Tools Used for Analysis:
You have the flexibility to choose any tool for your analysis. However, the preferred tools include:

MS Excel
Tableau/ PowerBI, etc
Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab, Matplotlib
Methodology Report
A comprehensive report outlining the methodology employed in your analysis. The report should be concise and may include references, tables, figures, and results. The acceptable file formats are either a PowerPoint (ppt) or a PDF. If you utilize tools like Excel, please include details about the Excel formulas used in the analysis.

Marking Criteria:
Evaluation of your reports will consider various metrics, including:

Writing Style, References, Figures, etc.
Dataset Exploration
Methods
Results of Analysis
Discussion
Feel free to present your findings in a clear and organized manner, utilizing the chosen tools to provide valuable insights from the dataset.

Problem 2 : Extracting Legal Insights from FIR Images

It takes a lot of effort and time to extract important legal information from First Information Report (FIR) papers. The manual analysis of legalese and content might cause delays and even misinterpretations.

Challenge Statement:
Develop a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that can automatically process FIR images and identify the applicable IPC sections:
Analyse the textual content within the FIR image to pinpoint the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) associated with the reported crime.
Classify the criminal act: Categorise the criminal activity described in the FIR based on the identified IPC sections. Recommend potential punishments: Based on the classified act and relevant IPC sections, suggest the range of punishments typically awarded for such offenses.
Examples for Analysis :
Develop algorithms for accurate text extraction and image processing from FIR documents.
Develop models to effectively analyse the extracted text and identify relevant legal information.
Build robust models for crime classification and potential punishment prediction based on the extracted legal data.
Bonus Challenge :
Draw attention to how difficult it might be to handle handwritten content and different layouts in FIRs. Stress how crucial it is to take the changing nature of legal interpretations into account.

Presentation and Code
Share your insights in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.
Share your code accordingly.


Marks will be awarded based on the quality of the presentation.
Dataset Description:
The hackathon will provide a dataset of FIR images along with corresponding annotations indicating the applicable IPC sections, criminal act categories, and potential punishments.
